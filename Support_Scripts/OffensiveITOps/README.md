#### Offensive IT Ops

[Tanoy Bose](https://twitter.com/tanoybose) has written a blog entry [Post Exploitation of Puppet and Ansible Servers](http://n0tty.github.io/2017/06/11/Enterprise-Offense-IT-Operations-Part-1/). As a part of it, he has released two scripts to help the pwnage.

- Pwnpet.sh : Pwnpuppet is a payload generator to hack systems in an puppet infrastructure using metasploit.
- Pwnsible.sh : Pwnsible is a payload generator to hack systems in an ansible infrastructure using metasploit.
